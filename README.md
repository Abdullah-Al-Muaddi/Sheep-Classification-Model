> Before going into details, Iâ€™d like to mention two Kaggle courses that really helped me jump into my first CNN Kaggle competition (each ~4 hours):  
> * ðŸ“š [Intro to Deep Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning)  
> * ðŸ“š [Computer Vision](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/computer-vision)

Within this competition, I tried to apply what I learned during those courses, along with techniques I explored from other contestants.

I know there might be other ideas to increase the F1 score â€” Iâ€™m ready to hear it from you!
